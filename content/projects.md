## Projects 

Below are a few projects I have created for my computational biology course. These demonstrate my skills in R and RStudio for data science:

- [Exploratory Data Analysis with Tidyverse Tools (Computational Biology Project)](/project1/)

- [Modeling, Testing, and Classification (Computational Biology Project)](/project2/)

- [Roger Springs Archaeological Site Analysis (Biostatistics Project using the data from my honor's thesis project)](content/rogersprings.pptx)
