###After taking this computational biology course, I have learned a number of ways to use both R and Python for data science. One of the most interesting things i've learned is how to make R and Python work together to manipulate list variables. I will now demonstrate how to create, sort, and combine lists in python and then manipulate the combined list in R to create a working dataset.


###Before I can begin working with Python in Rstudio, I must load in the required packages
```{r}
#R
Sys.setenv(RETICULATE_PYTHON="/usr/bin/python")
#install.packages("reticulate")
#install_miniconda()
library(reticulate)
use_python("/usr/bin/python")
```

###Creating two variables

Creating variables for the amount of time each animal spends in the shelter and whether they are a cat or dog.
```{python}
#Python

#Time in shelter for each cat (in months)
cattime = [2, 6, 1, 8, 7, 5, 3, 4, 4]

#Time in shelter for each dog (in months)
dogtime = [3, 1, 2, 4, 2, 5, 6, 3, 8]
```

### Sorting the variables by time
Now that I've created these two variables in python lets sort them ascending by time spent (in R we would use tidyverse's arrange())
```{python}
#Python

cattime.sort()
cattime
dogtime.sort()
dogtime
```

###Combining lists

I now want to combine both lists of 9 cats and 9 dogs into 1 list of 18 animals
```{python}
#Python

animaltime = cattime+dogtime
```

###Viewing list in R
Now that the lists are combined, let's look at the whole thing in R
```{r}
#R
py$animaltime
time<-as.numeric(py$animaltime)
time<-as.numeric(time)
```

###Creating a dataset from the python list in R
I want to make a dataset from these times that has a variable determining if the animal is a cat or a dog.
```{r}
#R

#The first 9 animals on the list are cats and the next 9 are dogs so we can make a list with 9 cats and 9 dogs and then cbind it to our time list

animal<-c("cat","cat","cat","cat","cat","cat","cat","cat","cat","dog","dog","dog","dog","dog","dog","dog","dog","dog")

animal<-as.character(animal)

shelter<-cbind(animal,time)

head(shelter)
```

###Manipulating the dataset
Now that the lists have been turned into an R dataset we can use it to learn about the differences between cats and dogs.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)

```
