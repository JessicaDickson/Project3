#### After taking this computational biology course, I have learned a number of ways to use both R and Python for data science. One of the most interesting things i've learned is how to make R and Python work together to manipulate list variables. I will now demonstrate how to create, sort, and combine lists in python and then manipulate the combined list in R to create a working dataset.

### Before I can begin working with Python in Rstudio, I must load in the required packages as well as the data "skulls"
```{r}
#R

#install.packages("reticulate")
#install_miniconda()
library(reticulate)
Sys.setenv(RETICULATE_PYTHON = "/usr/bin/python")
use_python("usr/bin/python")
```

### Creating two variables
Creating variables for the amount of time each animal spends in the shelter and whether they are a cat or dog.
```{python}
#Python

#Time in shelter for each cat (in months)
cattime = [2, 6, 2, 8, 7, 5, 3, 4, 4]
cattime=list(cattime)

#Time in shelter for each dog (in months)
dogtime = [3, 1, 2, 4, 2, 5, 6, 3, 4]
dogtime=list(dogtime)
```

### Sorting the variables by time and
Now that I've created these two variables in python lets sort them ascending by time spent (in R we would use tidyverse's arrange())
```{python}
#Python

#Sorted ascending
cattime.sort()
cattime

#Sorted ascending
dogtime.sort()
dogtime
```

###Getting summary statistics for each species
```{python}
#Average amount of time cats spend in the shelter
cattime_sum = sum(cattime)
print(cattime_sum/9)

#Average amount of time cats spend in the shelter
dogtime_sum = sum(dogtime)
print(dogtime_sum/9)

#Maximum and Minimum shelter times for cats
maxc=max(cattime)
minc=min(cattime)
print(minc, maxc)

#Maximum and Minimum shelter times for dogs
maxd=max(dogtime)
mind=min(dogtime)
print(mind, maxd)
```

### Combining lists

I now want to combine both lists of 9 cats and 9 dogs into 1 list of 18 animals
```{python}
#Python

animaltime = cattime+dogtime
```

### Viewing list in R
Now that the lists are combined, let's look at the whole thing in R
```{r}
#R
time<- py$animaltime

```

### Creating a dataset from the python list in R
I want to make a dataset from these times that has a variable determining if the animal is a cat or a dog.
```{r}
#R

#The first 9 animals on the list are cats and the next 9 are dogs so we can make a list with 9 cats and 9 dogs and then cbind it to our time list

animal<-c("cat","cat","cat","cat","cat","cat","cat","cat","cat","dog","dog","dog","dog","dog","dog","dog","dog","dog")


shelter<-as.data.frame(cbind(animal,time))

shelter$time<-as.character(shelter$time)
shelter$time<-as.numeric(shelter$time)

shelter$animal<-as.character(shelter$animal)

str(shelter)
head(shelter)
```

### Manipulating the dataset
Now that the lists have been turned into an R dataset we can use it to learn about the differences between cats and dogs.

```{r}
#R
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)

#Finding the averages, max, and mean in R now
shelter %>% group_by(animal) %>% summarise(avg=mean(time))
shelter %>% group_by(animal) %>% summarise(min=min(time), max=max(time))

```
### A Little fun with linear regression
```{r}
#now that we've manipulated the data in both python and r and imported it to r. 

fit1<-lm(dist~speed, data=cars) #syntax for simple linear regression
coef(fit1)
```

This shows the many possibilities of combining r and
